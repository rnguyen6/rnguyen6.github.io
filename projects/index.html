		Projects I found interesting enough to save. Feel free to contact me for more information. Open images in a new tab for better quality.<br><br>

        	<strong>Sound Voltex Controller &raquo;</strong><br>
		<img src="sdvx.jpg" alt="SDVX" height="200" align="right">
		Cheap DIY controller for a rhythm game. Used Arduino Micro, some arcade buttons, and a cardboard box.
        	<br><br>

		<strong>Apache Spark Clusters &raquo;</strong><br>
		Constructed a cluster-computing framework using Apache Spark in Python3. Two personal computers are slightly faster than one.
        	<br><br>

        	<strong>Image Stitching</strong> &raquo;</h5><br>
        	Learned basic image stitching procedures using Python3 and OpenCV. Enabled fun planar picture profiling.
		<br><br>

		<strong>32-bit Processor Design &raquo;</strong><br>
		Designed a 32-bit processor via ModelSim from scratch. If anything taught me low-level coding, it's this.<br>
		Prior to this, another 32-bit processor was designed using a base 8-bit CPU.
		<br><br>
		
		<strong>Scarlet Hawks UAV &raquo;</strong><br>
		Computer engineer in a room of aerospace engineers. Imagine processing really plays to my strength.<br>
		Competition was fun, can't say failing was.
        	<br><br>

		<strong>CPU Monitor &raquo;</strong><br>
		UI shell, but programmed using low-level machine code. Really makes you appreciate high level abstraction.
		<br><br>

		<strong>LiCoO2 Batteries &raquo;</strong><br>
		From learning the basics of chemistry to being about to pinpoint flaws in design. Only reason for being part of the project was curiosity, as nothing related to CPE.
        	<br><br>

		<strong>Big Data Project &raquo;</strong><br>
		Learned Rhino and CAD to pump out prototypes. Communication skills are a new high after working with foreigners who don't speak English well.
