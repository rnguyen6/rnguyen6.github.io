		Projects I found interesting enough to save. Feel free to contact me for more information.<br><br>
        	<strong>Apache Spark Clusters&raquo;</strong><br>
		Constructed a cluster-computing framework using Apache Spark in Python3 through two personal computers. Allowed for marginal increase in program execution speed.
        	<br>
        	<strong>Image Stitching</strong> &raquo;</h5><br>
        	Learned basic image stitching procedures using Python3 and OpenCV. Enabled fun planar picture profiling.
		<br>
		<strong>32-bit Processor Design</strong><br>
		Designed a 32-bit processor via ModelSim from scratch. If anything taught me low-level coding, it's this.<br>
		Prior to this, another 32-bit processor was designed using a base 8-bit CPU.
		<br>
		<strong>CPU Monitor</strong><br>
		UI shell, but programmed using low-level machine code. Really makes you appreciate high level abstraction.
