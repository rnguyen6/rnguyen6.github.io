	<h1>PROJECTS</h1>
	<p>
		Projects I found interesting enough to save. Feel free to contact me for more information.<br>
	</p>
	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>Sound Voltex Controller &raquo;</strong><br>
		Cheap DIY controller for a rhythm game. Used Arduino Micro, some arcade buttons, and a cardboard box.
	</p></td><td><img src="sdvx.jpg" alt="SDVX" height="200"></td></tr></table>
		
	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>Apache Spark Clusters &raquo;</strong><br>
		Constructed a cluster-computing framework using Apache Spark in Python3. Two personal computers are slightly faster than one.
	</p></td><td></td></tr></table>

	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>Image Stitching</strong> &raquo;</h5><br>
		Learned basic image stitching procedures using Python3 and OpenCV. Enabled fun planar picture profiling.
	</p></td><td><img src="dog_result.jpg" alt="Dog Stitch" height="200"></td></tr></table>

	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>32-bit Processor Design &raquo;</strong><br>
		Designed and synthesised a 32-bit processor using a base 8-bit CPU with Virtuoso.<br>
		Approached again with ModelSim, except from scratch. If anything taught me low-level coding, it's this.
	</p></td><td><img src="selcpu32layout.PNG" alt="Select Adder CPU" height="200"></td></tr></table>

	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>Scarlet Hawks UAV &raquo;</strong><br>
		Computer engineer in a room of aerospace engineers. Image processing really plays to my strength.<br>
		Competition was fun, but we certainly had a lot to learn.
	</p></td><td><img src="uav.PNG" alt="UAV" height="200"></td></tr></table>

	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>CPU Monitor &raquo;</strong><br>
		UI shell, but programmed using low-level machine code. Really makes you appreciate high level abstraction.
	</p></td><td></td></tr></table>

	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>LiCoO2 Batteries &raquo;</strong><br>
		From learning the basics of chemistry to being about to pin-point flaws in design or procedure. Only reason for being part of the project was curiosity, as nothing related to CPE.
	</p></td><td><img src="licoo2.PNG" alt="TEM LiCoO2" height="200"></td></tr></table>

	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>Big Data Project &raquo;</strong><br>
		Learned Rhino and CAD to pump out prototypes. Communication skills are a new high after working with foreigners who don't speak English well.
	</p></td><td><img src="haf.PNG" alt="Hybrid Air Filter" height="200"></td></tr></table>
	
	<table style="width:100%"><tr><td><p><strong>Robotics Competition &raquo;</strong><br>
		In-school competition where autonomous robots push pucks across to the opponent's side. Made more interesting by switching partners every round.
	</p></td><td><img src="puck_robot.JPG" alt="Puck Robot" height="200"></td></tr></table>
